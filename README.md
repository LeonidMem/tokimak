# tokimak
A Gradle plugin which provides modding tools for making Toki mods. (Fabric mods for the Paper server software)
## State
For now this is a fork of [paperweight userdev](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight) with additions like proper Mixin remapping. 
For now the only supported mappings are Mojang ones. \
Later we plan to make a fork of [Loom](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loom) instead, so there will be support of all fabric infrastructure features. (a fork of paperweight was easier to make)
